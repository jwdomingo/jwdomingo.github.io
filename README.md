The Scheme of Things
====================

johndomingo.com is my first hand-coded website. It is intended to serve as the landing page for my web portfolio where I highlight and test past and current projects.

The Scheme of Things is my blog. It traces my journey as an aspiring web developer and in it I write about the languages and technologies I am learning. I also want to chronicle my experiences my evolving process so I can look back and reflect upon my growth.

Follow me and find out how it all turns out!
