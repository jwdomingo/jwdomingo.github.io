Happy new year. I resolve to blog regularly about the happenings in my (new) career, life, et al. I have exactly one week before my last day of work and then it's off to better and brighter opportunities. There's been a huge gap since the last time I updated! I promise to be more diligent this year.

I also started learning Spanish and am also giving speed reading a go. Soy un ni√±o. I think that's how it works.

I've got a lot of wrapping up to do this week. Laying low on the programming projects until I fully transition out of my current position but it's getting to the point where I need to start letting things go. More on this tomorrow, it's almost midnight!
