Happy 2016! This one's going to be a big one, I can really feel it: exciting career, new challenges, and better opportunities. I think in my last update I was still preparing to apply to Hack Reactor and now I'm about ready to take the plunge. Just a few more loose ends to tie up before it's off to this intensely immersive three-month sprint I've spent the last two years preparing for.

So much is about to change and I've got a rekindled fire to blog more consistently. If not simply to keep track of my progress, I hope it will help me keep my priorities at hand and my goals in sight. I realize my writing is awful so this will also help some of that. I promise to be more diligent this year despite knowing it's only follower will be my Mom.

Last year's resolution was to not give up on love and while I laughed out loud at the idea throughout the year, I realize in hindsight that I actually stuck to it. In many ways it seems like a pretty intangible goal, but I think that made it all the more tangible in the end. It was a simple reminder I was able to keep chanting to myself all year long. And let's see, there were approximately two heartbreak..ing moments (note there were zero heartbreaks though at the time I thought they were, ha what a joke). But I'm not deterred and I think that's why resolutions like these can be so powerful.

The same resolve carries over to the new year but with a slight caveat: the goal is not to give up on me (inspired by a wise friend). This year's going to see the latter half of my 25, and even if Adele has anything to say about it, it's not going to be one filled with regrets!

So I've got a lot of wrapping up to do this week. Laying low on the programming projects until I fully transition out of my current position. It's finally getting to the point where I'm realizing it's okay to let things go. More on this tomorrow but for now, I've got to clock in this commit before it strikes midnight!
