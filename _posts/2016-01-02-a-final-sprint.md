Five weeks ago, I was reeling over the idea of telling my boss that I'd be leaving the company in the new year. When all I could think of was how painful that experience would be, I remembered that I've always had the agency to determine my path and my decisions should be external to anyone else's expectations. Somewhere along the way I lost sight of this notion and even when I had the bravado to think this much of myself in high school I didn't have had the words for it then. But I do now and it's this self-awareness that I hope takes this idea from attitude to aptitude. Gosh, I'm cheesy.

I was inspired by this: When talking about finding the guts to start his restaurant empire, Momofuku founder David Chang attributed it to a "healthy dose of naivet&eacute; and... being young enough to be selfish and realize that if everything failed [he] would still be 27 years old and [his] whole life ahead of [him]." Romantic, stupid, call it what you will. I'm going to grab this one by the horns and give it a go.

Hack Reactor, Day 1 is coming in just nine days. It's a tremendous risk. I emptied my entire savings on this. I am still trying to line up all my silver eggs and amending my budget constantly. But at the end of the day, the best thing I can do for myself is come in strong, full confidence, full speed ahead. Who knows what will come of this or where I'll be in three months but there it is: it's three months. That's less time than any of those grueling semesters I spent not really knowing what or why I was studying whereas I can confidently say I am in a position I set myself up for two years ago. I made a carefully calculated decision and I'm nowhere near the idea of turning back any time soon.

So here's to one last sprint before life takes a drastic turn and I can really start feeling like the adult I am. Lol. Hey, no flack okay? I make adult decisions and can hold adult liquor. Sometimes, it's precisely this sort of courage (liquid or otherwise) that you need to make it out there.
