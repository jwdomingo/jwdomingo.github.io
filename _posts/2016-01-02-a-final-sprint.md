Five weeks ago, I was reeling over the idea of telling my boss that I'd be leaving the company in the new year. All I could think of was how painful that experience would be, but then I remembered this little nugget: I am the sole agent when it comes to determining my path and my decisions should be external to anyone else's expectations. Easier said than done?

Somewhere along the way I lost sight of this notion. Even when I had the bravado to think this much of myself in high school I don't think I had the words for it then. But I do now and it's this self-awareness that I hope takes this way of thinking from attitude to aptitude. Gosh, this is getting cheesy.

Let me elaborate with a brief [aside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyr4QM_Q86w): When talking about finding the guts to start his restaurant empire, Momofuku founder David Chang attributed it to a "healthy dose of naivet&eacute; and... being young enough to be selfish and realize that if everything failed [he] would still be 27 years old and [his] whole life ahead of [him]." Romantic, stupid, call it what you will but I'm going to grab this one by the horns and give it a go.

Hack Reactor, Day 1 is coming in just nine days. It's a tremendous risk. I emptied my entire savings for this. I am still trying to line up all my little eggs; constantly amending my budget; and figuring out how to uphold my daily routine. At the end of the day, the best thing I can do for myself is come in strong, full confidence, full speed ahead.

Who knows what will come of this or where I'll be in three months but then there it is: *it's only three months*. That's less time than any of those grueling college semesters I spent not really knowing what or why I was studying. I'm in a position I carefully set myself up for two years ago and I'm going to put all my confidence in that calculated decision. I'm nowhere near backing out any time soon.

So here's to one last sprint before life takes a drastic turn and I can really start feeling like the adult I am. Lol. Hey, no flack okay? I make adult decisions and can hold adult liquor too. That counts. And sometimes, it's precisely this sort of courage (liquid or otherwise) that you need to make it out there.
