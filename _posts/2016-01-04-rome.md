First real workout of the year today and it was.. a lot. Ha!. Got back in town (Oakland) and accidentally napped the afternoon away. When I woke up I treated myself to three hours at the gym doing some back squats and AMRAPs at CrossFit V16 and some boxing/sparring at Great Western Power Company (CrossFit is in GWPC and to be honest, I don't know why I'm even telling you this. This is *my* gym! Stay out!).

Our CrossFit coach has a new fitness program for us and it's codenamed 'ROME'. I'm assuming it's a play on the familiar adage but if not, it inspired this post so whoop dee doo for you.

I've been living in retrospect this entire week; I can't stop thinking about the life I'm about to set aside for the next three months and possibly never see again come April. It's a scary thought knowing I've set myself for all of this but in many ways, I still don't think I'm fully prepared.

I want to get this right. What I'm about to do is a great opportunity and I refuse to miss a beat. Classes are from 9AM to 8PM and then students are encouraged to stay until 11PM, listening to guest speakers, networking with important peeps, and/or working on projects. A member of my cohort mentioned to me that he is going to avoid burnout by leaving once class is officially over (8PM). I get it, this is a great form of retention buuut I also know I'm not going to be able to do that.

All I can think of is if there was ever a time to network with as many people as possible, this is it. Everyone around me will be so eager to learn how to navigate the tech world and establishing those pivotal relationships will be key, so you know what? I want my nose in everybody's business, point blank and the period. I am sacrificing way too much to not take advantage of every opportunity possible.

(Omg quick aside, I love blogging. I've never been consistent with diaries of any sort so this is exciting &emdash; Day Four!!)

So on to how Rome was not built in a day: It's been two years of preparation and yet the ball keeps rolling. There is no end in sight, and that's precisely how I like it. Great things aren't built in two years. Great things aren't built in three months. I realize Hack Reactor is not going to lay the shiny golden career path of my dreams but here's what it will do: it will help me lay that first brick. The larger picture tells me it's going to be my hard work that's going to determine how successful I am. This is not a shortcut; there are no shortcuts.

For the longest time I thought Hack Reactor was perfect because it's crammed down curriculum was perfect for an overachiever like me. But I think the best way to see this picture is to accept that this is not going to be the magical solution to my career confusion; it's not going to skyrocket me to my dream career; and where ever it takes me it's by no means an end-all be-all.

Hard blipping work. That's how this is going to happen. Forget shortcuts, forget easy. If I'm going to play for this, it better be worth it. Sheesh, I'm so pumped up now. Like, I just did that to myself by reflecting on my circumstances and trying to make an honest entry for the day and gosh, I freaking love blogging. *At first, I thought it was a sad handwritten book... (lmao!)*

Alright, peace out purty people. And date me if you got that reference right thur ^
