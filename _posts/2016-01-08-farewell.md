This is the kind of goodbye I like. The one where you know it's only going to be a short time before you see everyone again, and yet you make a big deal about the whole farewell thing because who knows where you'll be in 3 months?

I've been toying with this idea that I am saying goodbye to a life(style) I may never see again. Right now, life is work next to a beautiful park, live in a pretty awesome neighborhood, and work out at the best gym.
