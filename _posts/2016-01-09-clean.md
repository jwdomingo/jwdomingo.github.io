It's an odd thing when you're cleaning out your desk. You start out emptying a drawer and the next thing you're packing up the last two years. You find notes that weren't quite thought out and projects that will never be completed and the whole experience can be pretty draining after eight and a half hours of over-time past what was already supposed to be your last day.

Is my conscious clean after not completing my work?
